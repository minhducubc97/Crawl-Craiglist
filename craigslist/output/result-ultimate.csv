I'm looking for someone to help me develop a simple device to assist with the testing of small, battery-operated electronics.

I recently purchased a lot of hundreds of old Game Boy Pockets that I want to resell, but I need to test each end every one to see if they're all working first, so I don't inadvertently sell broken merchandise.  This product takes 2 AA batteries, but I don't have time to put in and take out the batteries hundreds of times.  Instead, I'd like to build a handheld (or some other type of) battery-pack which clips onto the back of each Game Boy that well allow me to test these Game Boy Pockets quickly and easily, without having to put batteries in and out of each one.

This so-called ""game-boy tester"" is simply a 2xAA battery pack, with a built-in clip that allows you to easily clip the battery pack onto the back of the Game Boy, where the battery terminals are.  The ""clip"" will probably have to be 3D-printed so it fits well.

I'm looking for someone who can build me a kick-ass tester - someone with experience with building/prototyping small gadgets and mechanical devices, 3D-printing, etc., who can use good materials and make something strong and sturdy that can withstand the testing of hundreds or thousands of pieces.

Please reply to this ad if you think you can help me build this thing.  I'm offering $250, but I'll most-likely want to enlist some helpers to help with the testing, so we may need to make additional testers, and I will pay another $100 for each additional tester (plus the cost of materials).
